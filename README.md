# Network_Traffic_Sniffer
A python network traffic sniffer built with scapy

A Python-based network packet sniffer that captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time. This tool helps understand network communication patterns and demonstrates fundamental packet analysis techniques.



 The Basic Concept

# Simplified workflow:
1. Capture packet from network interface
2. Check packet type (IP, TCP, UDP)
3. Extract source/destination information  
4. Display results in readable format

 Key Features
- Real-time packet capture from any network interface
- Protocol analysis for IP, TCP, and UDP packets
- Command-line interface for easy use
- Root permission handling with helpful error messages


 Core Components
1. Packet Handler- Analyzes each captured packet
2. Argument Parser - Handles command-line options
3. Main Controller - Manages the sniffing process

 Usage

# Capture on specific interface
sudo python3 basic_sniffer.py -i eth0

# Capture on any interface  
sudo python3 basic_sniffer.py -i any




 Dependencies
- Python 3
- Scapy - Packet manipulation library
- Root privileges - Required for network interface access

### Supported Protocols
- IP - Internet Protocol packets
- TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (web, email)
- UDP - User Datagram Protocol (DNS, video calls)


 Technical Skills Gained
- Understanding of network packet structures
- Experience with Python's Scapy library
- Command-line argument parsing in Python
- Network interface configuration and management

Cybersecurity Concepts
- Packet sniffing fundamentals
- Network traffic analysis
- Protocol identification and analysis
- Ethical considerations of network monitoring

Ethical Usage 
This tool is for educational purposes only. Always ensure you have proper authorization before monitoring any network traffic. Unauthorized packet sniffing may violate laws and organizational policies.
